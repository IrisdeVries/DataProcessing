Questions Data Processing week 2

1. Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.

== -> you get true or false when the values are the same. Sometimes automatic conversions occur. 
The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean values state that 0, NaN, and the empty string ("") count as false, 
while all the other values count as true. Because of this, expressions like 0 == false and "" == false are also true.

Where you do not want any automatic type conversions to happen, you can use === or !==
=== -> whether a value is precisely equal to the other.

2. Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaSript programs use clorures very often.)
A function that “closes over” some local variables. 

3. Explain what higher order functions are.
Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

4. Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector. 
It takes a selector string and returns an array-like object containing all the elements that it matches.

<p>And if you go chasing
  <span class="animal">rabbits</span></p>
<p>And you know you're going to fall</p>
<p>Tell 'em a <span class="character">hookah smoking
  <span class="animal">caterpillar</span></span></p>
<p>Has given you the call</p>

<script>
  function count(selector) {
    return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
  }
  console.log(count("p"));           // All <p> elements
  // → 4
  console.log(count(".animal"));     // Class animal
  // → 2
  console.log(count("p .animal"));   // Animal inside of <p>
  // → 2
  console.log(count("p > .animal")); // Direct child of <p>
  // → 1
